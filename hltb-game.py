HowLongToBeat Spider
Daniel Greeen / KasumiL5x

Purpose:
  This spider crawls HowLongToBeat (HLTB) and retrieves game information for each known game on the website.
  This is my first web scraping project! :)

Notes:
  HLTB's url doesn't change unless accessing a game directly, so scraping a search page is hard, as it's dynamically inserted.
  Their game page is 'game.php?id=ID', so the obvious method is to find the maximum ID.  However, I have found IDs that are
  vastly beyond their number of games, and found plenty of empty IDs that should be valid, so this isn't an option.
  However, I noticed that main page JS queries '/search_results.php?page=ID' which yields what would be injected in.
  We can find the page limit (1996 a the time of writing) and generate the appropriate links to parse, which in turn should
  give us every game on the website.

  I will be exporting two separate scrapes:
    On the game's Overview tab, I will pull game information and *overall* summary statistics.
    On the game's Completions tab, I will pull all entries for each game by hand.

  search_results.php:
    div.search_list_image > a
      Returns all of the individual game tiles in the search.
    ./@href
      Chained to the above, extracts the partial game link as 'game.php?id=ID'.

  game.php
    Overview
      div.profile_header
        Game title.
      li.short.time_100
        Array of game times. Nested <h5> is the name, and <div> is the value. Value may be '--' for missing.
        Expected names are 'Main Story', 'Main + Extras', 'Completionist', 'All Styles'.
      div.profile_info
        Array of game information. Its text is the actual value. Nested <strong> is the name of the data.
        'Type' is a single entry (for DLC etc.).
        'Developer' is a single entry. 'Developers' is a comma-space separated list.
        'Publisher' is a single entry. 'Publishers' is a comma-space separated list.
        'Playable On' is a comma-space separated list.
        'Genre' is a single entry. 'Genres' is a comma-space separated list.
        'NA' is a single entry (North America release date).
        'EU' is a single entry (EU release date).
        'JP' is a single entry (Japan release date).
