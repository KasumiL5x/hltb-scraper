# HowLongToBeat Scraper
> A web spider that crawls HowLongToBeat to extract game and completion time data.

## Purpose
[HowLongToBeat](https://howlongtobeat.com) (HLTB) is a great website for discovering times that people take to complete games.  While ripe with data, it's unfortunately lacking an API.  This project scrapes all known games (at the time of writing) on the website, extracting the game data as well as all existing completion entries.

This project is part of my venture into the world of data science.
